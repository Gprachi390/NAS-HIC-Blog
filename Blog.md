Dataset Modification and Pipelinging with Pytorch:

For the PyTorch execution, we want to pipeline the 11k hand's dataset with the Pytorch in light of the fact that PyTorch upholds and gives just some standard datasets like Cifar-10, Mnist, Fashion Mnist, and so forth. For this, we will convert the dataset into images and labels with which, we can proceed further in implementation.
Below is the snapshot of the source code to perform the required operation:
