Blog on Neural Architecture Search For Hand Image Classification 
o get the best model for some dataset, hyperparameter tuning is being taken care of. There becomes a need for optimized architectures such that there is no overfitting on the training dataset. But to come up with the best model manually becomes difficult. It becomes computationally expensive to find the optimized architecture. So, for solving this problem Neural Architecture Search is used. NAS automates the process of finding the best architecture using the search strategy in the search space.
